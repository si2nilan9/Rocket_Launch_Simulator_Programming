Assume: 
Initially : Fuel level=FULL             Altitude=0km    Speed=0km/h   
Stage 1   : Fuel level=DECREASE BY 1    Altitude=10km    Speed=1000km/h
Stage 2   : Fuel level=DECREASE BY 1    Altitude=400km    Speed=40000km/h
Entering Stage 2, when Fuel level less than 50
Mission success if fuel contains minimum level(0), altitude reaches 1200km/h
